# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. I am a transfer student from Cerritos College, and I'm more interested in platform fighters and maybe some shooter games. My preferred name is Ivan, mainly because I've had teachers think my first name is Andres according to their roll call sheet when it really isn't, and my pronouns are he/him. Two games I play the most are Smash Ultimate and Happy Wheels (I've made and publish some levels there, and I also speedrun its iOS version!), and I am taking this class to gain some additional skills for game programming, as I have somewhat self-taught myself how to use Godot.

2.
    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. Aside from learning another game engine, I hope to transfer the skills I learn from this class to my current knowledge of Godot.

4. Not sure if I can think of anything at this point.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

2. Game development (any engine)

3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

2. Scope management

3. Iteration

4. Object-Oriented programming

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
